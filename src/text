Jason Torres

I'm a technical co-founder.

10+ years of Ruby on Rails experience. 8 years as a CTO/Engineering Lead.

I've worked on almost 50+ projects of various sizes throughout my career as a developer, designer, architect, adviser, and a founder.

With clients globally, my works have reached and been used by companies like Deloitte, Github, Martha Stewart, Techcrunch, and more.

I've been leading software engineering teams for more than a decade and successfully launched startups and companies in San Francisco, Melbourne, London, and Manila. I travel frequently on these cities so we can arrange a meet for coffee or beer. People say I'm generally a nice guy so we'll get along easily.

I'm actively looking for founders to build companies with. If you're only looking for a team to build your product, I can do that too.
