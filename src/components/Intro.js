          <h4>About Me</h4>
          <p>
            I've been leading software engineering teams for more than a decade
            and successfully launched startups and companies in San Francisco,
            Melbourne, London, and Manila.

          <p>
            I travel frequently on those cities so we can arrange a meet for
            coffee or beer. People say I'm generally a nice guy so we'll get
            along easily.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I founded Mashup Garage. A full stack software engineering house
            based in Manila, Philippines.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Together with my team, we built products that have been used by
            companies like Deloitte, Lonely Planet, Github, Martha Stewart,
            Techcrunch, and more.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>I love prototyping stuff. Let's do something together!</p>
