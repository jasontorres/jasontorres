After a long wait, I was finally able to work on this website and update it. Coming out of a semi-retirement on coding (heck, it's long story), I'm finally able to start spending more time with an editor and loving every single moment of it.

There's more to come here. It's just getting this out of the way so I can work on a few exciting things within Mashup Garage. Building new products, onboarding new work, 2018 has been a very good year for us and I'm so excited of things to come.
